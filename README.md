|---|-------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| | WORK     | |
| | | Python   | Every time I need to do something with a csv |

| | | CSS      | I usually remember to remove magenta borders |
| | | React    | Joyfully participating in the class vs. hook cycle  |
| | | Docker   | Deprived myself of the excuse "It works on my computer".  Mostly. | 
| | | Git | I push, I pull, I usually explain why |
| | PLAY | |
| | | Cycling | Any given day I outrun or at least draw my demons |
| | | Movies | Given enough time, I will explain Billy Jack to you. In painful detail. |

When not gainfully employed, I like to vandalize my github profile, start projects and occasionally even finish them.
